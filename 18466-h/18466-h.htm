<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<br>
<p>Virgil&mdash;Publius Vergilius Maro&mdash;was born at Andes near Mantua, in the
year 70 <small>B.C.</small> His life was uneventful, though he lived in stirring
times, and he passed by far the greater part of it in reading his
books and writing his poems, undisturbed by the fierce civil strife
which continued to rage throughout the Roman Empire, until Octavian,
who afterwards became the Emperor Augustus, defeated Antony at the
battle of Actium. Though his father was a man of humble origin, Virgil
received an excellent education, first at Cremona and Milan, and
afterwards at Rome. He was intimate with all the distinguished men
of his time, and a personal friend of the Emperor. After the
publication of his second work, the <i>Georgics</i>, he was recognized
as being the greatest poet of his age, and the most striking figure
in the brilliant circle of literary men, which was centred at the
Court. He died at Brindisi in the spring of 19 <small>B.C.</small> whilst returning
from a journey to Greece, leaving his greatest work, the <i>Aeneid</i>,
written but unrevised. It was published by his executors, and
immediately took its place as the great national Epic of the Roman
people. Virgil seems to have been a man of simple, pure, and loveable
character, and the references to him in the works of Horace clearly
show the affection with which he was regarded by his friends.</p>

<p>Like every cultivated Roman of that age, Virgil was a close student
of the literature and philosophy of the Greeks, and his poems bear
eloquent testimony to the profound impression made upon him by his
reading of the Greek poets. His first important work, the <i>Eclogues</i>,
was directly inspired by the pastoral poems of Theocritus, from whom
he borrowed not only much of his imagery but even whole lines; in
the <i>Georgics</i> he took as his model the <i>Works and Days</i> of Hesiod,
and though in the former case it must be confessed that he suffers
from the weakness inherent in all imitative poetry, in the latter
he far surpasses the slow and simple verses of the Boeotian. But here
we must guard ourselves against a misapprehension. We moderns look
askance at the writer who borrows without acknowledgment the
thoughts and phrases of his forerunners, but the Roman critics of
the Augustan Age looked at the matter from a different point of view.
They regarded the Greeks as having set the standard of the highest
possible achievement in literature, and believed that it should be
the aim of every writer to be faithful, not only to the spirit, but
even to the letter of their great exemplars. Hence it was only natural
that when Virgil essayed the task of writing the national Epic of
his country, he should be studious to embody in his work all that
was best in Greek Epic poetry.</p>

<p>It is difficult in criticizing Virgil to avoid comparing him to some
extent with Homer. But though Virgil copied Homer freely, any
comparison between them is apt to be misleading. A primitive epic,
like the <i>Iliad</i> or the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, produced by an imaginative
people at an early stage in its development, telling its stories
simply for the sake of story telling, cannot be judged by the same
canons of criticism as a literary epic like the <i>Aeneid</i> or <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, which is the work of a great poet in an age of advanced culture,
and sets forth a great idea in a narrative form. The Greek writer
to whom Virgil owes most perhaps, is Apollonius of Rhodes, from whose
<i>Argonautica</i> he borrowed the love interest of the <i>Aeneid</i>. And
though the Roman is a far greater poet, in this instance the advantage
is by no means on his side, for, as Professor Gilbert Murray has so
well said, 'the Medea and Jason of the <i>Argonautica</i> are at once more
interesting and more natural than their copies, the Dido and Aeneas
of the <i>Aeneid</i>. The wild love of the witch-maiden sits curiously
on the queen and organizer of industrial Carthage; and the two
qualities which form an essential part of Jason&mdash;the weakness which
makes him a traitor, and the deliberate gentleness which contrasts
him with Medea&mdash;seem incongruous in the father of Rome.' But though
Virgil turned to the Greek epics for the general framework and many
of the details of his poem, he always remains master of his materials,
and stamps them with the impress of his own genius. The spirit which
inspires the <i>Aeneid</i> is wholly Roman, and the deep faith in the
National Destiny, and stern sense of duty to which it gives
expression, its profoundly religious character and stately and
melodious verse, have always caused it to be recognized as the
loftiest expression of the dignity and greatness of Rome at her best.
But the sympathetic reader will be conscious of a deeper and more
abiding charm in the poetry of Virgil. Even in his most splendid
passages his verses thrill us with a strange pathos, and his
sensitiveness to unseen things&mdash;things beautiful and sad&mdash;has
caused a great writer, himself a master of English prose, to speak
of 'his single words and phrases, his pathetic half lines, giving
utterance as the voice of Nature herself to that pain and weariness,
yet hope of better things, which is the experience of her children
in every age.'</p>

<p>The task of translating such a writer at all adequately may well seem
to be an almost impossible one; and how far any of the numerous
attempts to do so have succeeded, is a difficult question. For not
only does the stated ideal at which the translator should aim, vary
with each generation, but perhaps no two lovers of Virgil would agree
at any period as to what this ideal should be. Two general principles
stand out from the mass of conflicting views on this point. The
translation should read as though it were an original poem, and it
should produce on the modern reader as far as possible the same effect
as the original produced on Virgil's contemporaries. And here we
reach the real difficulty, for the scholar who can alone judge what
that effect may have been, is too intimate with the original to see
clearly the merits of a translation, and the man who can only read
the translation can form no opinion. However, it seems clear that
a prose translation can never really satisfy us, because it must
always be wanting in the musical quality of continuous verse. And
our critical experience bears this out, since even Professor Mackail
with all his literary skill and insight has failed to make his version
of the <i>Aeneid</i> more than a very valuable aid to the student of the
original. The meaning of the poet is fully expressed, but his music
has been lost. That oft-quoted line&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>'Sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt'</blockquote>

<p>haunts us like Tennyson's</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When unto dying eyes<br>
The casement slowly grows a glimmering square,'</blockquote>

<p>and no prose rendering can hope to convey the poignancy and pathos
of the original. The ideal translation, then, must be in verse, and
perhaps the best way for us to determine which style and metre are
most suited to convey to the modern reader an impression of the charm
of Virgil, will be to take a brief glance at some of the best-known
of the verse translations which have appeared.</p>
<a name="intro11"></a>
<p>The first translation of the <i>Aeneid</i> into English verse was that
of Gawin Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld in Scotland, which was published
in 1553. It is a spirited translation, marked by considerable native
force and verisimilitude, and it was certainly unsurpassed until
that of Dryden appeared. In the best passages it renders the tone
and feeling of the original with extreme felicity&mdash;indeed, all but
perfectly. Take for instance this passage from the Sixth Book&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>'Thai walking furth fa dyrk, oneth thai wyst<br>
    Quhidder thai went, amyd dym schaddowys thar,<br>
    Quhar evir is nycht, and nevir lyght dois repar,<br>
    Throwout the waist dongion of Pluto Kyng,<br>
    Thai voyd boundis, and that gowsty ryng:<br>
    Siklyke as quha wold throw thik woddis wend<br>
    In obscure licht, quhen moyn may nocht be kenned;<br>
    As Jupiter the kyng etheryall,<br>
    With erdis skug hydis the hevynnys all<br>
    And the myrk nycht, with her vissage gray,<br>
    From every thing hes reft the hew away.'</blockquote>

<p>But in spite of its merits, its dialect wearies the modern reader,
and gives it an air of grotesqueness which is very alien to the spirit
of the Latin. One other sixteenth-century translation deserves
notice, as it was written by one who was himself a distinguished poet;
namely, the version of the second and fourth books of the <i>Aeneid</i>
written by Henry, Earl of Surrey. It gained the commendation of that
stern critic Ascham, who praises Surrey for avoiding rhyme, but
considers that he failed to 'fully hit perfect and true versifying';
which is hardly a matter for wonder since English blank verse was
then in its infancy. But it has some fine passages&mdash;notably the one
which relates the death of Dido&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>'As she had said, her damsell might perceue<br>
    Her with these wordes fal pearced on a sword<br>
    The blade embrued and hands besprent with gore.<br>
    The clamor rang unto the pallace toppe,<br>
    The brute ranne throughout al thastoined towne,<br>
    With wailing great, and women's shrill yelling,<br>
    The roofs gan roare, the aire resound with plaint,<br>
    As though Cartage, or thauncient town of Tyre<br>
    With prease of entred enemies swarmed full,<br>
    Or when the rage of furious flame doth take<br>
    The temples toppes, and mansions eke of men.'</blockquote>

<p>Of the translations into modern English, that of Dryden may still
be said to stand first, in spite of its lack of fidelity. It owes
its place to its sustained vigour, and the fact that the heroic
couplet is in the hands of a master. In its way nothing could be better
than&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>'Just in the gate, and in the jaws of hell,<br>
    Revengeful cares, and sullen sorrows dwell,<br>
    And pale diseases, and repining age&mdash;<br>
    Want, fear, and famine's unresisted rage,<br>
    Here toils and death, and death's half-brother sleep,<br>
    Forms terrible to view, their sentry keep.<br>
    With anxious pleasures of a guilty mind,<br>
    Deep frauds, before, and open force behind;<br>
    The Furies' iron beds, and strife that shakes<br>
    Her hissing tresses, and unfolds her snakes.'</blockquote>

<p>But though the heroic couplet may have conveyed to Dryden's age
something of the effect of the Virgilian hexameter, it does nothing
of the kind to us. Probably we are prejudiced in the matter by Pope's
Homer.</p>

<p>Professor Conington's translation certainly has spirit and energy,
but he was decidedly unfortunate in his choice of metre. To attempt
to render 'the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man'
by fluent octosyllabics was bound to result in incongruity, as in
the following passage, where the sombre warning of the Sibyl to
Aeneas becomes merely a sprightly reminder that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>'The journey down to the abyss<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is prosperous and light,<br>
    The palace gates of gloomy Dis<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand open day and night;<br>
    But upward to retrace the way<br>
    And pass into the light of day,<br>
    There comes the stress of labour; this<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May task a hero's might.'</blockquote>

<p>The various attempts that have been made to translate the poem in
the metre of the original have all been sad failures. And from Richard
Stanyhurst, whom Thomas Nash described as treading 'a foul,
lumbering, boistrous, wallowing measure, in his translation of
Virgil,' down to our own time, no one has succeeded in avoiding faults
of monotony and lack of poetical quality. A short extract from Dr.
Crane's translation will illustrate this very clearly&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No species of hardships,<br>
    Longer, O maiden, arises before me as strange and unlooked for:<br>
    All things have I foreknown, and in soul have already endured them.<br>
    One special thing I crave, since here, it is said, that the gateway<br>
    Stands of the monarch infernal, and refluent Acheron's dark pool:<br>
    Let it be mine to go down to the sight and face of my cherished<br>
    Father, and teach me the way, and the sacred avenues open.'</blockquote>

<p>Nor is William Morris' attempt to devise a new metre anything but
disappointing. It is surprising that so delightfully endowed a poet
should have so often missed the music of Virgil's verse as he has
done in his translation, and the archaisms with which his work
abounds, though they might be suitable in a translation of Homer,
are only a source of irritation in the case of Virgil.</p>

<p>For the best metre to use we must look in a different direction.
Virgil made use of the dactylic hexameter because it was the literary
tradition of his day that epics should be written in that metre. In
the same way it might be argued, the English tradition points to blank
verse as the correct medium. This may be so, but its use demands that
the translator should be as great a poet as Virgil. Had Tennyson ever
translated the <i>Aeneid</i>, it would doubtless have been as nearly
faultless as any translation could be, as is shown by the version
of Sir Theodore Martin, which owes so much of its stately charm to
its close adherence to the manner of Tennyson. A typical passage is
the description of Dido's love for Aeneas&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>'Soothsayers, ah! how little do they know!<br>
    Of what avail are temples, vows, and prayers,<br>
    To quell a raging passion? All the while<br>
    A subtle flame is smouldering in her veins,<br>
    And in her heart a silent aching wound.<br>
<br>
       *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       *<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                             Now Dido leads<br>
    Aeneas round the ramparts, to him shows<br>
    The wealth of Sidon, all the town laid out,<br>
    Begins to speak, then stops, she knows not why.<br>
    Now, as day wanes, the feast of yesterday<br>
    She gives again, again with fevered lips<br>
    Begs for the tale of Troy and all its woes,<br>
    And hangs upon his lips, who tells the tale.<br>
    Then, when the guests are gone and in her turn<br>
    The wan moon pales her light, and waning stars<br>
    Persuade to sleep, she in her empty halls<br>
    Mourns all alone, and throws herself along<br>
    The couch where he had lain: though he be gone<br>
    Far from her side, she hears and sees him still.'</blockquote>

<p>Of the merits of the present translation the reader will judge for
himself; but it may perhaps be said of the usual objections urged
against the Spenserian stanza&mdash;that it is cumbrous and monotonous,
and presents difficulties of construction&mdash;that the two former
criticisms will be just or the reverse, according to the skill of
the writer, while it is quite possible that the last is really an
advantage, for the intricate machinery imposes a restraint on
careless or hasty composition. And finally we must turn a deaf ear,
even to so high an authority as Matthew Arnold, when he says that
it is not suited to the grand manner. When he said this he cannot
have remembered either the lament of Florimell in the <i>Faerie Queene</i>
or the conclusion of <i>Childe Harold</i>.</p>

<br>
<p>Edward Fairfax Taylor, whose translation of the <i>Aeneid</i> is now
published, was descended from the Taylors of Norwich, a family well
known for their culture and intellectual gifts. He was the only son
of John Edward Taylor, himself an accomplished German and Italian
scholar, and the first translator of the <i>Pentamerone</i> into English,
who lived at Weybridge near his aunt, Mrs. Sarah Austin. Brought up
among books, young Taylor early showed an intense love for classical
literature, and soon after going to Marlborough he began the present
translation as a boy of sixteen. His admiration for Spenser led him
to adopt the Spenserian stanza, and in the preface to his translation
of the first two books he gives detailed reasons for considering it
peculiarly well adapted for the <i>Aeneid</i>. He was a favourite pupil
of the late Dr. Bradley, Dean of Westminster, at that time headmaster
of Marlborough, and who much wished that he should follow in the
footsteps of 'that brilliant band of Marlborough men,' as they have
been called, who at that time, year after year, gained the Balliol
scholarship. But circumstances made him decide otherwise, and in
1865 he passed the necessary examination for a clerkship in the House
of Lords. The long vacations gave him time to continue this labour
of love, and in the intervals of much other literary work, and in
spite of ill health, he completed the translation of the twelve books
of the <i>Aeneid</i>. He looked forward to re-editing it and bringing it
out when he should have retired from his work in the House of Lords,
but this day never came, and he died from heart disease in January
1902. His was a singularly charming disposition, and he was beloved
by all who knew him; while the courage and patience with which he
bore ever-increasing suffering, and the stoicism he showed in
fulfilling his duties in the House of Lords, have left a deep
impression on all his friends.</p>

<p><small>The <i>Edisso Princeps</i>, of Virgil is that printed at Rome by Sweynham
and Pannartz. It was not dated, but it is almost certain that it was
printed before the Venice folio edition of V. de Spira, which was
issued in 1470. The best modern critical editions of the text are
those of Ribbeck (4 vols. 1895) and F. A. Hirtzel (<i>Scriptorum
Classicorum Bibliotheca Oxoniensis</i>, 1900). Of the editions
containing explanatory notes, that of Conington and Nettleship,
revised by Haverfield, is the standard English commentary. That of
A. Sidgwick (2 vols. Cambridge) is more elementary, but will be found
valuable. Those of Kennedy (London, 1879) and of Papillon and Haigh
(Oxford, 2 vols. 1890-91) may also be referred to.</small></p>

<p><small>Virgil was first introduced to English readers by William Caxton in
1490. But his <i>Eneydos</i> was based, not on the <i>Aeneid</i> itself, but
on a French paraphrase, the <i>liure des eneydes</i>, printed at Lyons
in 1483.</small></p>

<p><small>The best modern prose translations are those of Mackail (London,
1885) and Conington (London, 1870).</small></p>

<p><small>The following is a list of the more important verse translations of
the <i>Aeneid</i> which have appeared. The name of the translator, and
the date at which his translation appeared, are given:&mdash;Gawin
Douglas, 1553 (see <a href="#intro11">Introduction</a>); Henry, Earl of Surrey, 1557
(Books II. and IV. only); J. Dryden, 1697; C. R. Kennedy, 1861; J.
Conington, 1866; W. Morris, 1876; W. J. Thornhill, 1886; Sir Charles
Bowen, 1887 (Books I.-VI. only); J. Rhoades, 1893 (Books I.-VI.
only); Sir Theodore Martin, 1896 (Books I.-VI. only); T. H. D. May,
1903; E. Fairfax Taylor, 1903.</small></p>

<p><small>Fate sends &AElig;neas to Latium to found Rome, but Juno's hostility long
delays his success (<a href="#book1line1">1-45</a>). Descrying him and his Trojans in sight
of Italy, she bribes &AElig;olus to raise a storm for their destruction
(<a href="#book1line46">46-99</a>). The tempest (<a href="#book1line100">100-116</a>).
The despair of &AElig;neas (<a href="#book1line109">117-126</a>). One
Trojan ship is already lost, when Neptune learns the plot and lays
the storm (<a href="#book1line127">127-189</a>). &AElig;neas escapes, lands in Libya, and heartens
his men (<a href="#book1line190">190-261</a>). Venus appeals to Jupiter, who comforts her with
assurance that &AElig;neas shall yet be great in Italy. His son shall found
Alba and his son's sons Rome. Juno shall eventually relent, and Rome
under Augustus shall be empress of the world (<a href="#book1line262">262-351</a>). Mercury is
sent to secure from Dido, Queen of Libya, a welcome for &AElig;neas. &AElig;neas
and Achates, while reconnoitring, meet Venus in the forest disguised
as a nymph. She tells them Dido's story. &AElig;neas in reply bewails his
own troubles, but is interrupted with promises of success. Let him
but persist, all will be well (<a href="#book1line352">352-478</a>). Venus changes before their
eyes from nymph to goddess, and vanishes before &AElig;neas can utter his
reproaches. Hidden in a magic mist, the pair approach Carthage, which
they find still building. They reach the citadel unobserved, and are
encouraged on seeing pictures of scenes from the Trojan war (<a href="#book1line478">479-576</a>).
Dido appears and takes her state. To her enter, as suppliants, Trojan
leaders, whom &AElig;neas had imagined dead. Ilioneus, their spokesman,
tells the story of the storm and asks help. "If only &AElig;neas were
here!" (<a href="#book1line577">577-661</a>). Dido speaks him fair and echoes his words, "If
&AElig;neas were here!" The mist scatters. &AElig;neas appears; thanks Dido,
and greets Ilioneus (<a href="#book1line658">662-723</a>). Dido welcomes &AElig;neas to Carthage and
prepares a festival in his honour. &AElig;neas sends Achates to summon
his son and bring gifts for Dido (<a href="#book1line721">724-774</a>). Cupid, persuaded by Venus
to personate Ascanius and inspire Dido with love for &AElig;neas, comes
with the gifts to Dido's palace, while Ascanius is carried away to
Idalia. The night is passed in feasting. After the feast Iopas sings
the wonders of the firmament, and Dido, bewitched by Cupid, begs
&AElig;neas to tell the whole story of his adventures (<a href="#book1line775">775-891</a>).</small></p>

<h3>BOOK TWO</h3>
<br>
<center>A<small>RGUMENT</small></center>
<br>
<p><small>&AElig;neas' story.&mdash;The Greeks, baffled in battle, built a wooden horse,
in which their leaders took ambush. Their fleet sailed to Tenedos.
The Trojans, but for Capys and Laocoon, had dragged the horse
forthwith as a trophy into Troy (<a href="#book2line1">1-72</a>). Sinon, a Greek, brought
before Priam, feigns righteous indignation against Greece. The
Trojans sympathise and believe his story of wrongs done him by Ulysses
(<a href="#book2line73">73-126</a>). "When Greek plans of flight had often," says Sinon, "been
foiled by storms, oracles foretold that only a human sacrifice could
purchase their escape." Chosen for victim, Sinon had fled. He
solemnly declares the horse to be an offering to Pallas. "Destroy
it, and you are lost. Preserve it in your citadel, your revenge is
assured" (<a href="#book2line127">127-222</a>). Treachery triumphs. Laocoon's cruel fate is
ascribed to his sacrilegious attack upon the horse, which is brought
with rejoicing into Troy, despite a last warning, from Cassandra
(<a href="#book2line217">223-288</a>). While Troy sleeps, the fleet returns, and Sinon releases
the Greeks from the horse (<a href="#book2line289">289-315</a>). Hector's wraith warns &AElig;neas
in a dream to flee with the sacred vessels and images (<a href="#book2line316">316-351</a>), and
Panthus brings news of Sinon's treachery. The city is in flames.
&AElig;neas heads a forlorn hope of rescue (<a href="#book2line352">352-441</a>). He and his followers
exchange armour with certain Greeks slain in the darkness. The ruse
succeeds until they are taken for enemies by their friends. The
Greeks rally. The Trojans scatter. At Priam's palace a last stand
is made, but Pyrrhus forces the great gates, and the defenders are
massacred (<a href="#book2line442">442-603</a>). Priam's fate.&mdash;The sight of his headless corpse
draws &AElig;neas' thoughts to his own father's danger. Hastening
homewards he espies Helen, and is pausing to take vengeance and her
life, when (<a href="#book2line604">604-711</a>) Venus intervening opens his eyes to see the gods
aiding the Greeks (<a href="#book2line712">712-756</a>). &AElig;neas regains his home. Anchises
obstinately refuses to flee, until a halo is seen about the head of
Ascanius (<a href="#book2line757">757-828</a>), whereupon he accepts the omen and yields. The
escape.&mdash;In a sudden panic Creusa is lost (<a href="#book2line829">829-900</a>). &AElig;neas, at peril
of his life, is seeking her throughout the city, when her wraith
appears and bids him away. "She is dead in Troytown: in Italy empire
awaits him." She vanishes: day dawns: and &AElig;neas, with Anchises and
the surviving Trojans, flees to the hills (<a href="#book2line901">901-972</a>).</small></p>

<center>A<small>RGUMENT</small></center>
<br>
<p><small>In obedience to oracles the Trojans build a fleet and sail to Thrace
(<a href="#book3line1">1-18</a>). Seeking to found a city, they are warned away by the ghost
of Polydorus and visit Anius in Ortygia (<a href="#book3line19">19-99</a>). Apollo promises
&AElig;neas and his descendants world-wide empire if they return to "the
ancient motherland" of Troy,&mdash;which Anchises declares to be Crete
(<a href="#book3line100">100-144</a>). They reach Crete, only to be again baffled. Drought and
plague interrupt this second attempt to found a city. On the point
of returning to ask Apollo for clearer counsel, &AElig;neas in a dream
is certified by the home-gods of Troy that the true motherland is
Italy (<a href="#book3line145">145-207</a>). Anchises owns his mistake, and recalls how
Cassandra had in other days been mocked for prophesying that Troy
should eventually be transplanted to Italy (<a href="#book3line208">208-225</a>). Landing in the
Strophades, they unwittingly wrong the Harpies, whose queen Celaeno
thereupon threatens them with a portentous famine. Panic-stricken,
they coast along to Actium, where they celebrate their national games
and leave a defiance to the Greeks (<a href="#book3line226">226-342</a>). At Buthrotum they find
Helenus and Andromache in possession of the kingdom of Pyrrhus, and
by them are entertained awhile and sent upon their way with gifts
and guidance (<a href="#book3line343">343-577</a>). The voyage from Dyrrhachium and the first
glimpse of Italy. They land and propitiate Juno: then coast along
till they sight Mount &AElig;tna (<a href="#book3line577">578-666</a>). After a description of the
rescue of Achemenides and the escape from Polyphemus, the voyage and
the story end with the death of Anchises at Drepanum (<a href="#book3line667">667-819</a>).</small></p>

<h3>BOOK FOUR</h3>

<center>A<small>RGUMENT</small></center>
<br>
<p><small>Dido opens her heart to her sister. But for her promised loyalty to
the dead Sych&aelig;us, she must have yielded (<a href="#book4line1">1-36</a>). Anna pleads for
&AElig;neas, and Dido half-yielding sacrifices to the marriage-gods. The
growth of her passion is described (<a href="#book4line37">37-104</a>). Venus feigns assent to
Juno's proposal that &AElig;neas shall marry Dido and be king of Carthage.
At a hunting Juno will send a storm and the lovers will shelter in
a cave, and there plight their vows (<a href="#book4line100">105-144</a>). The plot is
consummated. Dido yields (<a href="#book4line145">145-198</a>). Description of Rumour, who
bruits abroad the story and rouses the jealous Iarbas to conjure his
father, Jupiter, to interpose (<a href="#book4line199">199-248</a>). Jupiter sends Mercury to
remind &AElig;neas of his mission (<a href="#book4line244">249-298</a>). &AElig;neas, terrified by the
message, prepares for instant flight, to the delight of his followers
and the despair of Dido (<a href="#book4line298">299-342</a>), who entreats him to stay, and
rehearses the dangers to which he is leaving her (<a href="#book4line343">343-374</a>). &AElig;neas
is obdurate. Although he loves Dido, he is the slave of a destiny
which he must at all costs fulfil (<a href="#book4line370">375-410</a>). After calling down a
solemn curse upon him Dido swoons, but crushing the impulse to
comfort her, he hastens his preparations for departure (<a href="#book4line406">411-468</a>).
Dido sends Anna with a last appeal to &AElig;neas, who nevertheless, in
spite of struggles, obeys the gods (<a href="#book4line469">469-513</a>). In utter misery Dido,
on pretext of burning all &AElig;neas' love-gifts, prepares a pyre and
summons a sorceress. Her preparations complete, she utters her last
lament (<a href="#book4line514">514-639</a>). Mercury repeats his warning to &AElig;neas, who sails
forthwith (<a href="#book4line640">640-671</a>). Daybreak reveals his flight, and Dido&mdash;cursing
her betrayer&mdash;falls by her own hand, to the despair of her sister
and the consternation of her subjects (<a href="#book4line667">672-837</a>).</small></p>

<br>
<p><small>&AElig;neas, unaware of Dido's fate, sails away to Acestes in Sicily, and
prepares funeral games against the anniversary of Anchises' death
(<a href="#book5line1">1-90</a>). Offerings are paid to the spirit of Anchises. Sicilians and
Trojans assemble for the first contest, a boat race (<a href="#book5line91">91-140</a>), which
is described at length. Cloanthus, ancestor of the Cluentii, wins
with the "Scylla" (<a href="#book5line136">141-342</a>). The foot-race is next narrated.
Euryalus, by his friend's cunning, gains the first prize, and the
scene shifts (<a href="#book5line343">343-441</a>) to the ring, in which Dares is defeated by
the veteran Entellus, who fells the ox, his prize, as an offering
to his master Eryx (<a href="#book5line442">442-594</a>). After some wonderful shooting in the
archery which follows, &AElig;neas awards the first prize to Acestes, as
the favourite of the gods (<a href="#book5line595">595-667</a>). Before this contest is over
&AElig;neas summons Ascanius and his boy-companions to perform the
elaborate manoeuvres afterwards celebrated in Rome as the "Trojan
Ride" (<a href="#book5line667">668-729</a>). Juno schemes to destroy the Trojan fleet, while the
games are being held. She inspires with discontent the Trojan matrons,
who are not present at the festival. They set fire to the ships
(<a href="#book5line730">730-810</a>). Ascanius hurries to the scene. Jupiter sends rain and
saves all the ships but four (<a href="#book5line811">811-855</a>). Nautes advises &AElig;neas to
leave behind the weak and aged with Acestes. The wraith of Anchises
enforces the advice, and bids &AElig;neas visit him in the nether-world
(<a href="#book5line856">856-909</a>). Preparations for departure. Acestes accepts his new
subjects, and the Trojans depart. Venus prevails on Neptune to grant
them safe convoy in return for the life of the helmsman Palinurus,
who is drowned (<a href="#book5line910">910-1062</a>).</small></p>

<br>
<p><small>Arrived at Cum&aelig; &AElig;neas visits the Sibyl's shrine, and, after prayer
and sacrifice to Apollo, asks access to the nether-world to visit
his father (<a href="#book6line1">1-162</a>). He must first pluck for Proserpine the golden
bough and bury a dead comrade (<a href="#book6line163">163-198</a>). After the death and burial
of Misenus, &AElig;neas finds and gathers the golden bough (<a href="#book6line199">199-261</a>).
Preparation and Invocation (<a href="#book6line262">262-328</a>). The start (<a href="#book6line325">329-333</a>). The
"dreadful faces" that guard the outskirts of Hell. Charon's ferry
and the unburied dead (<a href="#book6line334">334-405</a>). Palinurus approaches and entreats
burial. Passing by Charon and Cerberus, they see the phantoms of
suicides, of children, of lovers, and experience Dido's disdain
(<a href="#book6line406">406-559</a>). From Greek and Trojan shades Deiphobus is singled out to
tell his story (<a href="#book6line559">560-644</a>). The Sibyl hurries &AElig;neas on past the
approach to Tartarus, describing by the way its rulers and its
horrors. Finally, they reach Elysium and gain entrance (<a href="#book6line640">645-757</a>).
The search among the shades of the Blessed for Anchises, and the
meeting between father and son (<a href="#book6line757">758-828</a>). Anchises explains the
mystery of the Transmigration of Souls, and the book closes with the
revelation to &AElig;neas of the future greatness of Rome, whose heroes,
from the days of the kings to the times of Augustus, pass in
procession before him (<a href="#book6line829">829-1071</a>). He is then dismissed through the
Ivory Gate, and sails on his way to Caieta (<a href="#book6line1072">1072-1080</a>).</small></p>

<br>
<p><small>Passing Caieta and Circeii, &AElig;neas sails up the Tiber (<a href="#book7line1">1-45</a>). Virgil
pauses to enumerate the old rulers of Latium and to describe the state
of the country at the coming of &AElig;neas. Latinus is King. Oracles have
foretold that by marriage with an alien his only daughter is to become
the mother of an imperial line. Fresh signs and wonders enforce the
prophecy (<a href="#book7line46">46-126</a>). The Trojans eat their tables (<a href="#book7line127">127-171</a>). An
embassage is sent to the Latin capital, and after conference Latinus
offers peace to the Trojans and to &AElig;neas his daughter's hand
(<a href="#book7line172">172-342</a>). Juno, the evil genius of Troy, again intervenes and
summons to her aid the demon Alecto (<a href="#book7line343">343-410</a>), who excites first
Amata then Turnus against the proposed peace, and finally (<a href="#book7line406">411-576</a>)
provokes a pitched battle between Trojans and Latins (<a href="#book7line577">577-648</a>).
Alecto is scornfully dismissed by Juno, who causes war to be formally
declared (<a href="#book7line649">649-747</a>). The war-fever in Italy. Catalogue of the leaders
and nations that gather to destroy &AElig;neas, chief among them being
Turnus and Camilla (<a href="#book7line748">748-981</a>).</small></p>

<br>
<p><small>Mustering of Italians, and embassage to Diomedes (<a href="#book8line1">1-18</a>). Tiber in
a dream heartens &AElig;neas and directs him to Evander for succour.
&AElig;neas sacrifices the white sow and her litter to Juno, and reaches
Evander's city Pallanteum&mdash;the site of Rome (<a href="#book8line19">19-117</a>). &AElig;neas and
Evander meet and feast together. The story of Cacus and the praises
of Hercules are told and sung. Evander shows his city to &AElig;neas
(<a href="#book8line118">118-432</a>). Venus asks and obtains from Vulcan divine armour for her
son (<a href="#book8line433">433-531</a>). At daybreak Evander promises &AElig;neas further succour.
Their colloquy is interrupted by a sign from heaven (<a href="#book8line532">532-630</a>).
Despatches are sent to Ascanius and prayers for aid to the Tuscans.
&AElig;neas, his men and Evander's son Pallas are sent forth by Evander
with prayers for their success (<a href="#book8line631">631-720</a>). Venus brings to &AElig;neas the
armour wrought by Vulcan (<a href="#book8line721">721-738</a>). Virgil describes the shield, on
which are depicted, not only the trials and triumphs of Rome's early
kings and champions, but the final conflict also at Actium between
East and West and the world-wide empire of Augustus (<a href="#book8line739">739-846</a>).</small></p>

<h3>BOOK NINE</h3>

<br>
<p><small>Certified by Juno of the absence of &AElig;neas, Turnus leads his forces
against the Trojans. When they entrench themselves within their
lines, he attempts to burn their ships, which are thereupon changed
by Cybele into nymphs, and float away (<a href="#book9line1">1-144</a>). Turnus undaunted
harangues his men and beleaguers the camp (<a href="#book9line145">145-198</a>). Nisus and
Euryalus scheme, and petition, to sally forth to find &AElig;neas and a
rescue. Setting out with promise of rich rewards if successful, they
surprise the Latin Camp but are themselves in turn surprised and
slain (<a href="#book9line199">199-513</a>). Their victims are buried; their heads are paraded
on pikes before the Trojan Camp, to the agony of the mother of
Euryalus (<a href="#book9line514">514-576</a>). The allies assault the camp. Virgil invokes
Calliope to describe the fray (<a href="#book9line577">577-603</a>). The collapse of a tower and
losses on both sides prelude Ascanius' baptism of fire. He kills his
man (<a href="#book9line604">604-765</a>). The brothers Pandarus and Bitias open the camp-gates
in defiance. Bitias falls, and Pandarus, retreating, shuts Turnus
within the camp, who kills him, but failing to let in his friends
is eventually hard pressed (<a href="#book9line766">766-882</a>). The Trojans rally round
Mnestheus and Serestus. Turnus plunges into the river and with
difficulty escapes by swimming (<a href="#book9line883">883-927</a>).</small></p>

<h3>BOOK TEN</h3>

<center>A<small>RGUMENT</small></center>
<br>
<p><small>The gods meet in council. Venus pleads for the Trojans, Juno for the
Latins. Jupiter as a compromise leaves the arbitrament to Fate
(<a href="#book10line1">1-153</a>). The siege of the Trojan camp continues. &AElig;neas meanwhile
is sailing with his Arcadian and Tuscan allies down the Tiber
(<a href="#book10line154">154-207</a>). Catalogue of the helpers of &AElig;neas, who is presently
warned by the nymphs in what peril Ascanius stands: comes in sight
of the camp and with difficulty lands his men (<a href="#book10line208">208-369</a>). A
hard-fought battle by the river follows, of which Pallas and Lausus
are the heroes (<a href="#book10line370">370-531</a>). Pallas is killed by Turnus in single combat
(<a href="#book10line532">532-603</a>). &AElig;neas in revenge gives no quarter, but slays and slays,
until Juno, warned by Jupiter that if she would save Turnus even for
a time she must act at once, goes down into the battle and fashions
in the form of &AElig;neas a phantom, which flees before Turnus and lures
him into a ship, by which he is miraculously carried away to his
father's city (<a href="#book10line604">604-838</a>). Mezentius takes up the command, but after
performing prodigies of valour is wounded by &AElig;neas (<a href="#book10line838">839-954</a>).
Mezentius withdraws, and his son Lausus is killed while covering his
retreat. Thereupon Mezentius gets to horse and rides back to die in
a vain endeavour to avenge his son. &AElig;neas exults over Mezentius
(<a href="#book10line955">955-1089</a>).</small><p>

<p><small>&AElig;neas erects a trophy of Mezentius' arms, and sends the body of
Pallas with tears and lamentations to Evander (<a href="#book11line1">1-108</a>). A truce for
the burial of the dead is asked by the Latins, and sympathy with the
Trojan cause finds a spokesman in Drances (<a href="#book11line109">109-144</a>). The sorrow of
Evander and the funeral rites of Trojans and Latins (<a href="#book11line145">145-262</a>). The
ambassadors return from the city of Diomedes and report that he
praises &AElig;neas and counsels submission (<a href="#book11line262">263-336</a>). An anxious debate
follows: Latinus suggests terms of peace: Drances inveighs against
Turnus, who replies, protesting his readiness to meet &AElig;neas in
single combat, and presently seizes the opportunity afforded by a
false alarm of impending attack to break up the council. The Latin
mothers and maidens offer gifts and litanies to Pallas. Turnus arms
for battle (<a href="#book11line334">337-576</a>). Camilla and Messapus command the Latin horse;
Turnus prepares an ambuscade (<a href="#book11line577">577-612</a>). Diana tells the story of
Camilla and charges Opis, one of her nymphs, to avenge her should
she fall (<a href="#book11line613">613-684</a>). Opis watches the battle before the city of
Latinus (<a href="#book11line685">685-738</a>). The deeds and death of Camilla are recounted:
Aruns, her slayer, is slain by Opis (<a href="#book11line739">739-972</a>). The Latins are routed,
and Turnus, learning the news, abandons the ambush and hurries to
the city, closely followed by &AElig;neas (<a href="#book11line973">973-1026</a>).</small></p>

<h3>BOOK TWELVE</h3>
<br>
<center>A<small>RGUMENT</small></center>
<br>
<p><small>Turnus realises that he must now redeem his promise to meet &AElig;neas
in single combat, and refuses to be dissuaded either by Latinus or
by Amata (<a href="#book12line1">1-90</a>). The challenge is sent, and the two make ready. Lists
are prepared and spectators gather (<a href="#book12line91">91-153</a>). Juno warns the Nymph
Juturna to aid her brother Turnus (<a href="#book12line154">154-180</a>). After the terms of
combat have been ratified by oath and sacrifice, Juturna, in disguise,
by an opportune omen induces one of the assembled Latins to break
the truce and kill a Trojan (<a href="#book12line181">181-310</a>). &AElig;neas is wounded while
endeavouring to restrain his men from reprisals, and the fray becomes
general. Turnus deals death among the Trojans (<a href="#book12line307">311-441</a>). &AElig;neas is
miraculously healed, and at first pursues only Turnus&mdash;who is
carried off by Juturna (<a href="#book12line442">442-561</a>), but presently gives rein to his
anger and slays indiscriminately, until by Venus' advice he attacks
the city. Amata kills herself, believing Turnus dead (<a href="#book12line559">562-702</a>).
Turnus' eyes are opened. Seeing the city outworks in flames, he
returns and proclaims himself ready to meet &AElig;neas, who, welcoming
the challenge, rushes forward. All eyes are riveted on the two, when
Turnus' sword breaks, and once more he flees, pursued by &AElig;neas.
Juturna gives Turnus another sword, and Venus restores to &AElig;neas his
spear (<a href="#book12line703">703-918</a>). Follows a colloquy between Jupiter and
Juno.&mdash;Turnus must die. &AElig;neas shall marry Lavinia and be king. But
the new nation must keep the ancient rites and names of Latium, and
be called not Trojans but Latins. Juno yields, and Jupiter warns
Juturna to leave the battle (<a href="#book12line919">919-1026</a>). Turnus, being beside himself,
after a last superhuman effort, is struck down. &AElig;neas is about to
spare his life, when he sees upon his shoulder the spoils of Pallas,
and kills him (<a href="#book12line1027">1027-1107</a>).</small></p>

<h3>NOTES TO BOOK ONE</h3>
<br>

<a name="note1stanza1"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line1">I.</a> 'The Lavinian shore,' the coast of Italy

<p><a href="#book1line37">V.</a> 'The choice of Paris' refers to the Greek story that once when

as a prize for the fairest. Juno, Minerva and Venus each claimed it,
but the Trojan prince Paris, who was made judge, gave it to Venus.
<i>Ganymede</i> was a beautiful Trojan boy who was carried off to Olympus
to be Jove's cup-bearer.</p>

<a name="note1stanza6"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line46">VI.</a> Ajax, son of Oileus, desecrated Minerva's temple at Troy. (Cf.
<a href="#book2line478">Book II. stanza liv.</a>)</p>

<a name="note1stanza14"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line118">XIV.</a> The 'son of Tydeus' is Diomedes, one of the foremost Greek
warriors in the war with Troy. Aeneas narrowly escaped being slain
by him.</p>

<p>For <i>Sarpedon</i> see <a href="#book9line793">Book IX. stanza lxxxix.</a> and for <i>Simois</i> note on
<a href="#note6stanza14">Book VI. stanza xiv.</a></p>

<a name="note1stanza26"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line226">XXVI.</a> Acestes was king of Eryx in Sicily, which was called
'Trinacria' from its three promontories. See <a href="#book5line28">Book V. stanzas iv.</a> and
following.</p>

<a name="note1stanza27"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line235">XXVII.</a> See note on <a href="#note3stanza55">Book III. stanzas lv.</a> and following.</p>

<a name="note1stanza32"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line280">XXXII.</a> The legend was that Antenor escaped from Troy and established
a colony of Trojans at the northern end of the Adriatic. The <i>Timavus</i>

<p><a href="#book1line289">XXXIII.</a> <i>Patavium</i>. The modern Padua.</p>

<a name="note1stanza35"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line307">XXXV.</a> Ascanius or Iulus is the son of Aeneas.</p>

<a name="note1stanza36"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line316">XXXVI.</a> The legend was that Rhea Silvia, a priestess of Mars, bore
the twins Romulus and Remus. The two children were exposed and left
to die, but were found and nursed by a she-wolf.</p>

<a name="note1stanza38"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line334">XXXVIII.</a> This prophecy refers not to C. Julius Caesar but to his
nephew Augustus, as is shown by the references to the east (the battle
of Actium) and to the closing of the 'gates of Janus.' For an account
of the latter, see <a href="#book7line208">Book VII. stanza xxiv.</a></p>

<a name="note1stanza40"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line352">XL.</a> The 'son of Maia' is Mercury.</p>

<a name="note1stanza42"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line370">XLII.</a> Harpalyce was the daughter of a Thracian king and a famous
huntress.</p>

<a name="note1stanza49"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line433">XLIX.</a> <i>Byrsa</i>. This word, originally the Semitic word for 'citadel,'
was thought by the Greeks to be their own word <i>Byrsa</i> meaning 'a
bull's hide.' This mistake was probably the cause of the legend given
by Virgil.</p>

<a name="note1stanza55"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line487">LV.</a> <i>Paphos</i> in Cyprus was one of the chief centres of the worship of
Venus.</p>

<a name="note1stanza60"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line532">LX.</a> Priam was the king of Troy, and the Atridae were Agamemnon and
Menelaus. Achilles is described as fierce to both, because he
quarrelled with Agamemnon about a captive. It is with this quarrel
that the <i>Iliad</i> opens.</p>

<a name="note1stanza62"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line550">LXII.</a> <i>Rhesus</i>, king of Thrace, had come to help the Trojans. It had
been prophesied that if his horses ate Trojan grass or drank the water
of the river, Troy could never be taken. Diomedes (Tydides) prevented
this by capturing the horses.</p>

<a name="note1stanza63"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line559">LXIII.</a> <i>Troilus:</i> a son of Priam slain by Achilles.</p>

<a name="note1stanza64"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line568">LXIV.</a> Memnon, son of Aurora, the dawn-goddess, and Penthesilea,

by Achilles.</p>

<a name="note1stanza65"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line577">LXV.</a> The <i>Eurotas</i> was a river in Laconia, and Cynthus was a mountain
of Delos. Both places were supposed to be favourite haunts of the
goddess Diana. <i>Oreads:</i> mountain-nymphs. <i>Latona</i> was the mother
of Diana and Apollo.</p>

<a name="note1stanza70"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line622">LXX.</a> <i>Hesperia</i>, 'the western land,' means Italy.</p>

<p>The Oenotrian folk were an old Italian race settled in the south of
the peninsula, in Lucania. <i>Italus</i> is an eponymous hero and was
probably invented to account for the name <i>Italia</i>. Probably
<i>Italia</i> means 'the cattle land.'</p>

<a name="note1stanza82"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line730">LXXXII.</a> This Teucer, who was a Greek, must be carefully distinguished
from the founder of the Trojans. He was a son of the king of Salamis,
and on his return from the Trojan war was exiled by his father. He
fled to Dido's father Belus, and with the help of the latter founded
a new kingdom in Cyprus.</p>

<a name="note1stanza97"></a>
<p><a href="#book1line865">XCVII.</a> Bacchus was the god of wine and feasting.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>NOTES TO BOOK TWO</h3>
<br>

<a name="note2stanza22"></a>
<p><a href="#book2line190">XXII.</a> An oracle said that the citadel of Troy would never be taken
as long as the <i>Palladium</i>, or image of Pallas, remained in it. So
Diomedes and Ulysses stole the image.</p>

<a name="note2stanza32"></a>
<p><a href="#book2line280">XXXII.</a> Apollo had conferred on Cassandra the gift of prophecy. But
she deceived him, and as he could not take away his former gift, he
added as a curse that no one should ever believe her.</p>

<a name="note2stanza35"></a>
<p><a href="#book2line307">XXXV.</a> <i>Neoptolemus</i> was the son of Achilles and grandson of Peleus.</p>

<a name="note2stanza42"></a>
<p><a href="#book2line370">XLII.</a> <i>Sigeum</i> is the name of the promontory which juts out into the
Hellespont from the Troad.</p>

<a name="note2stanza55"></a>
<p><a href="#book2line487">LV.</a> The 'Atridan pair' were Agamemnon, king of Argos, and Menelaus,
king of Sparta, the sons of Atreus.</p>

<a name="note2stanza77"></a>
<p><a href="#book2line685">LXXVII.</a> Helen is called 'Tyndarean' because she was the daughter of
Tyndarus. Paris, son of Priam, had carried her off from her husband
Menelaus, and so caused the Trojan war.</p>

<a name="note2stanza83"></a>
<p><a href="#book2line739">LXXXIII.</a> The goddess Pallas (Athena) wore on her shield the head of
the snaky-haired monster Medusa, one of the Gorgons.</p>

<a name="note2stanza84"></a>
<p><a href="#book2line748">LXXXIV.</a> The walls of Troy were said to have been built by Apollo and
Neptune.</p>

<a name="note2stanza105"></a>
<p><a href="#book2line937">CV.</a> <i>Hesperia</i>, 'the western land,' here means Italy. The Tiber is
called Lydian from a tradition that the Lydians had colonised
Etruria.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>NOTES TO BOOK THREE</h3>
<br>

<a name="note3stanza10"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line82">X.</a> The <i>Nereids</i> were sea-nymphs, the daughters of Nereus. The island
mentioned is Delos, and the story referred to is that Jupiter hid
Latona, the mother of Apollo and Diana, on the floating island of
Delos, in order to shelter her from the jealousy of Juno. By means
of chains Apollo fixed Delos between the two small neighbouring
islands Myconos and Gyarus.</p>

<a name="note3stanza12"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line100">XII.</a> 'Thymbrean lord.' Apollo, so called from the town of Thymbra
in the Troad, where he was worshipped.</p>

<a name="note3stanza16"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line136">XVI.</a> Crete is called 'Gnosian' from 'Gnossos,' the chief town of the
island.</p>

VII. stanza vi.</a></p>

<a name="note3stanza29"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line253">XXIX.</a> The Strophades were a small group of islands off the south-west
coast of Greece. The story alluded to is that Phineus, king of Thrace,
unjustly put out the eyes of his sons. As a punishment the gods
blinded him, and sent the Harpies&mdash;loathsome monsters with the
bodies of birds and the faces of women&mdash;to defile and seize all the
food that was set before him. Phineus was at last freed from them
by Zetes and Calais, the sons of the North Wind, who drove the Harpies
from Thrace to the Strophades.</p>

<p>For Celaeno's prophecy, see note on <a href="#note7stanza16">Book VII. stanza xvi.</a></p>

<p><a href="#book3line406">XLVI.</a> <i>Xanthus</i> was a river that flowed near Troy. The 'Scaean Gate'
was the western gate of Troy and looked towards the sea. It was the
best known of the gates because most of the fighting took place before
it.</p>

<a name="note3stanza47"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line415">XLVII.</a> Apollo was called 'Clarian' from Claros (near Ephesus), where
there was a shrine and oracle of the god.</p>

<a name="note3stanza52"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line460">LII.</a> <i>Narycos</i>, or more properly <i>Naryx</i>, was a town of the Opuntian
Locri in Greece. Virgil follows the tradition that they went and
settled in the south of Italy at the close of the Trojan war.</p>

<p>The 'Sallentinian plain' was the land bordering on the Tarentine Gulf,
and 'Petelia' was on the east coast of Bruttium, and had been founded
by Philoctetes, after he had been expelled from Thessaly.</p>

<a name="note3stanza55"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line487">LV.</a> <i>Scylla</i> and <i>Charybdis</i> are taken from Homer. The former was
a terrible sea-monster with six heads, and the latter a whirlpool.
Tradition fixed their abode as the Straits of Messina. Scylla dwelt
in a cave on the Italian side, Charybdis on the Sicilian.</p>

<a name="note3stanza60"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line532">LX.</a> Dodona, in Epirus, was one of the famous oracles in Greece.</p>

<a name="note3stanza68"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line604">LXVIII.</a> The place was called 'Castrum Minervae,' and lay a few miles
to the north of the southern extremity of Calabria.</p>

<a name="note3stanza74"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line658">LXXIV.</a> <i>Enceladus</i> was one of the giants who had fought against the
gods, but Jupiter struck him down with a thunderbolt and buried him
under Mount Aetna.</p>

<a name="note3stanza87"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line775">LXXXVII.</a> <i>Pelorus</i> was the most northerly headland of the Straits
of Messina.</p>

<a name="note3stanza88"></a>
<p><a href="#book3line784">LXXXVIII.</a> <i>Plemmyrium</i> ('the place of the tides') is the headland
near the harbour of Syracuse, which was built on the island of Ortygia.
The legend which Virgil refers to relates that Alpheus, the god of
a river in Elis, fell in love with the nymph Arethusa while she was
bathing in his waters. Diana changed her into a stream, and in that
guise she fled from Alpheus under land and sea, finally issuing forth
in Ortygia. Alpheus pursued her, and mingled his waters with hers.</p>

<br>

<a name="note4stanza8"></a>
<p><a href="#book4line64">VIII.</a> '<i>Sire Lyaeus:</i>' Bacchus. These gods are mentioned in this
place as having to do with marriage&mdash;possibly they are invoked as
being specially the gods of Carthage.</p>

<a name="note4stanza15"></a>
<p><a href="#book4line127">XV.</a> The name 'Titan' as applied to the sun is curious. Perhaps it
is a reference to the Greek tale that Hyperion, one of the Titans,
was the father of the sun.</p>

<a name="note4stanza19"></a>
<p><a href="#book4line163">XIX.</a> The <i>Agathyrsians</i> were a Scythian tribe, and the <i>Dryopes</i> were
a Thessalian people who dwelt on Mount Parnassus, the especial home
of Apollo; Cynthus is a mountain in Delos.</p>

<a name="note4stanza26"></a>
<p><a href="#book4line226">XXVI.</a> 'Ammon' was the African Jupiter.</p>

<a name="note4stanza29"></a>
<p><a href="#book4line253">XXIX.</a> The 'Zephyrs' were the south-west winds, and so the right ones
to take the fleet of Aeneas to Italy from Carthage.</p>

<a name="note4stanza32"></a>
<p><a href="#book4line280">XXXII.</a> Atlas was the giant who held apart heaven and earth. Virgil
identifies him with the mountains which lie in North Africa between
the sea and the desert of Sahara. Atlas was the father of Maia, the
mother of Mercury. The latter is called 'Cyllenius' from his
birth-place, Mount Cyllene in Arcadia.</p>

<a name="note4stanza38"></a>
<p><a href="#book4line334">XXXVIII.</a> Mount Cithaeron, near Thebes, was famous for the revels
which took place there in honour of Bacchus.</p>

<a name="note4stanza44"></a>
<p><a href="#book4line388">XLIV.</a> Phoebus (Apollo) is called 'Grynoeus' from Grynium, a city of
Aeolis in Asia Minor. He was much worshipped in Lycia, hence his
oracles are often called 'Lycian lots.'</p>

<a name="note4stanza55"></a>
<p><a href="#book4line487">LV.</a> It was at Aulis in Boeotia that the Greek expedition against Troy
mustered.</p>

<a name="note4stanza60"></a>
<p><a href="#book4line532">LX.</a> In this passage Virgil has in mind the <i>Bacchae</i> of Euripides,
in which Pentheus goes mad, and perhaps the <i>Eumenides</i> of Aeschylus,
but it is more probable that in the latter case he is merely thinking
of Orestes as he is represented in tragedy.</p>

<a name="note4stanza66"></a>
<p><a href="#book4line586">LXVI.</a> <i>Hecate</i>, the goddess of the lower world, sometimes identified
with Proserpina, and sometimes with Diana. She was worshipped at
cross-roads by night.</p>

<p>For <i>Avernus</i>, see note on <a href="#note6stanza18">Book VI. stanza xviii.</a></p>

<p>The ancients believed that foals were born with a lump on their
foreheads. The name given to this was <i>hippomanes</i>, and it was
supposed to act as a powerful love-philtre.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO BOOK FIVE</h3>
<br>

<a name="note5stanza4"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line28">IV.</a> Eryx was the son of Venus and Butes, Aeneas son of Venus and
Anchises, hence they are called brothers here. Eryx is the legendary
founder of the town of that name on the west coast of Sicily, near
Mount Eryx.</p>

<a name="note5stanza6"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line46">VI.</a> The story was that Acestes was the son of the Sicilian river-god
Crimisus and Egesta, a Trojan maiden.</p>

<a name="note5stanza11"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line91">XI.</a> The myrtle was sacred to Venus. Helymus was the supposed founder
of the Elymi, a Sicilian tribe. He was a Trojan who had migrated to
Sicily from Troy.</p>

<a name="note5stanza16"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line136">XVI.-XVII.</a> The <i>gens Memmia</i> and the <i>gens Sergia</i> were two
distinguished Roman families who traced their descent from Trojans.
The only member of the family of Cluentius we know much about is the
disreputable person on whose behalf Cicero made a well-known speech.</p>

<a name="note5stanza26"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line226">XXVI.</a> Cape Malea is the most southerly point of Laconia in the
Peloponnesus, renowned for its storms.</p>

<a name="note5stanza32"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line280">XXXII.</a> <i>Panopea</i> was one of the Nereids or sea-nymphs. Portunus was
an ancient Roman sea-god. Originally he was, as his name implies,
a god of harbourage.</p>

<a name="note5stanza33"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line289">XXXIII.</a> Meliboea was a town at the foot of Mount Ossa in Thessaly.</p>

<a name="note5stanza56"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line496">LVI.</a> <i>Alcides</i>, a common name for Hercules, who was descended from
Alcaeus. Hercules slew Eryx in the boxing-match referred to.</p>

<a name="note5stanza68"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line604">LXVIII.</a> This refers to an incident mentioned in the <i>Iliad</i>. A truce
had been concluded by the Greek and Trojans but it was broken by
Pandarus, who shot an arrow at Menelaus.</p>

<a name="note5stanza72"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line640">LXXII.</a> The meaning of this passage is very obscure. For we are not
told what the portent signified either in this or the succeeding
books. The old interpretation was that it referred to the burning
of the ships (<a href="#book5line730">lxxxii.</a> and following), but it is more probable that
Virgil was thinking of the wars between Rome and Sicily.</p>

<a name="note5stanza77"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line685">LXXVII.</a> The mother of Augustus was a member of the Atian family, and
this passage was evidently inserted by Virgil with the special idea
of pleasing Augustus.</p>

<a name="note5stanza80"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line712">LXXX.</a> For Crete and the Labyrinth, see note on <a href="#note6stanza4">Book VI. stanza iv.</a></p>

<a name="note5stanza103"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line919">CIII.</a> The temple of Venus on Mount Eryx was very celebrated in
antiquity. Venus is called 'Idalian' from Idalium in Cyprus.</p>

<a name="note5stanza112"></a>
<p><a href="#book5line1000">CXII.</a> All the names that occur in this stanza are those of sea-gods
or sea-nymphs.</p>

<p><a href="#book5line1054">CXVIII.</a> The Roman poets placed the Sirens on some rocks in the
southern part of the bay of Naples.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO BOOK SIX</h3>
<br>

<a name="note6stanza1"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line1">I.</a> <i>Cumae</i> was the most ancient Greek colony in Campania. The
tradition was that it had been founded by immigrants from Cyme and
Aeolis and from Chaleis in Euboea. Hence its name, and the epithet
Virgil applies to it.</p>

<a name="note6stanza2"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line10">II.</a> The 'Sibyl' here mentioned was the most famous of the
prophetesses of antiquity. She was directly inspired by Apollo (the
Delian seer), and dwelt in a cavern near his temple. <i>Trivia</i> is an
epithet of Hecate. See note on <a href="#note4stanza66">Book IV. stanza lxvi.</a></p>

<a name="note6stanza3"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line19">III.</a> Daedalus, who built the labyrinth for Minos, incurred the wrath
of the latter and escaped from Crete with his son Icarus, by making
wings. He fastened them on with wax, and Icarus flying too near the
sun, his wings melted and he fell into the Aegean. Daedalus, however,
reached Cumae in safety.</p>

<a name="note6stanza4"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line28">IV.</a> On the gate were carvings representing various Cretan stories.
Androgeos was the son of Minos, king of Crete. He won all the contests
at the Panathenaic festival at Athens, whose king, Aegeus, slew him
out of jealousy. In revenge, Minos made war on the Athenians, and
forced them to pay a yearly tribute of seven youths and seven maidens,
who were devoured by the Minotaur. This monster was the offspring
of Pasipha&euml;, wife of Minos, and a bull sent by Neptune, and it lived
in the labyrinth built by Daedalus. The tribute continued to be paid
until Theseus, son of Aegeus, went to Crete as one of the seven.
Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, fell in love with him, and helped
him to slay the monster.</p>

<a name="note6stanza14"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line118">XIV.</a> <i>Xanthus</i> and <i>Simois</i> were two rivers which flowed through the
plain before Troy. The new Achilles is of course Turnus, king of the
Rutuli.</p>

<a name="note6stanza15"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line127">XV.</a> The Grecian town is Pallanteum, the chief city of Evander's
kingdom. See <a href="#book8line55">Book VIII. stanza vii.</a></p>

<a name="note6stanza16"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line136">XVI.</a> Acheron was the fabled river of the lower world. Virgil probably
had in his mind the real <i>Acherusia palus</i>, a gloomy marsh near
Naples.</p>

<a name="note6stanza18"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line154">XVIII.</a> There was a volcanic lake near Cumae called <i>Avernus</i>, whose
waters gave out sulphureous vapours. It was connected by tradition
with the lower world. Orpheus, the mythical poet, so charmed the gods
of the nether world by his harp-playing, that he was allowed to take
back to the upper world his dead wife Eurydice. Castor was mortal,
but his brother Pollux was immortal; so when the former was slain
in fight Pollux obtained from Jupiter permission that each should
spend half their time in heaven, half in Hades. Theseus descended
into Hades in order to carry off Proserpine. He was kept a prisoner
there until he was rescued by Hercules (Alcides), who came down to
carry off Cerberus, the three-headed dog who guarded the entrance
(see <a href="#book6line496">stanza lvi.</a>).</p>

<a name="note6stanza32"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line280">XXXII.</a> Virgil alludes to the promontory of Misenum on the north side
of the bay of Naples. The legend is a purely local one. There is no
mention of Misenus in Homer.</p>

<a name="note6stanza33"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line289">XXXIII.</a> 'Aornos' is a Greek word&mdash;'where no bird can come.'</p>

<a name="note6stanza35"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line307">XXXV.</a> 'The Furies' mother and her sister' were Night and Earth.</p>

<a name="note6stanza37"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line325">XXXVII.</a> 'Phlegethon' was the 'burning' river of the lower world.</p>

<a name="note6stanza39"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line343">XXXIX.</a> The beast of Lerna is the Lernean Hydra, slain by Hercules;
the others are terrible monsters slain by various heroes.</p>

<a name="note6stanza41"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line361">XLI.</a> Charon was the ferryman of the dead.</p>

<a name="note6stanza54"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line478">LIV.</a> Apollo was called Amphrysian because he tended the herds of
Admetus near the river Amphrysus in Thessaly. Here the epithet is
strangely transferred to Apollo's servant.</p>

<a name="note6stanza57"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line505">LVII.</a> Minos, king of Crete, became one of the judges of the dead,
in the under-world. His brother Rhadamanthus was the other. See
<a href="#book6line667">stanza lxxv.</a></p>

<a name="note6stanza59"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line523">LIX.</a> For Phaedra, see note on <a href="#note7stanza103">Book VII. stanza ciii.</a> Procris was
accidentally slain by her husband, Eriphyle was killed by her son
Alcmaeon, Evadne threw herself on her husband's funeral pyre, and
Laodamia also died with her husband. For Pasipha&euml;, see note on <a href="#note6stanza4">stanza
iv.</a></p>

<a name="note6stanza63"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line559">LXIII.</a> Tydeus, Parthenopaeus, and Adrastus were three of the seven
heroes who fought against Thebes. The other names are taken from the
<i>Iliad</i>.</p>

<a name="note6stanza77"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line685">LXXVII.</a> The two sons of Aloeus were Otus and Ephialtes, who
threatened to assail the Immortals by piling Pelion on Ossa and Ossa
on Olympus. Salmoneus of Elis was punished for having presumptuously
claimed divine honours.</p>

<a name="note6stanza80"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line712">LXXX.</a> Ixion was king of the Lapithae, and being taken to heaven by
Jupiter, made love to Juno, for which he was eternally punished.
Pirithous was his son, and was guilty of having, with Theseus,
attempted to carry off Proserpine.</p>

<a name="note6stanza93"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line829">XCIII.</a> <i>Lethe</i> was the river of forgetfulness, and those who drank
of it forgot their former life and were ready for a new one.</p>

<a name="note6stanza100"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line892">C.-CI.</a> The kings mentioned in these two stanzas are the earliest
mythical rulers of Alba Longa. Numitor was the father of Rhea Silvia
(Ilia), the mother of Romulus and Remus.</p>

<a name="note6stanza105"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line937">CV.</a> The Emperor Augustus was the nephew and adopted son of C. Julius
Caesar, who claimed to trace his descent back to Iulus, and so through
Aeneas to Venus herself.</p>

<a name="note6stanza108"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line964">CVIII.</a> The first king referred to is Numa Pompilius, who was a Sabine
born at Cures. Tullus and Ancus were the third and fourth kings of
Rome. They can none of them be considered historical figures.</p>

<a name="note6stanza109"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line973">CIX.</a> This Brutus expelled Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome.
His sons tried to restore the monarchy and he ordered them to be
executed.</p>

<a name="note6stanza110"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line982">CX.</a> The Decii, father and son, both died in battle, and the family
of the Drusi had many distinguished members. Manlius Torquatus was
celebrated for killing his son for disobeying orders. Camillus was
the great Roman hero of the fourth century <small>B.C.</small> He was five times
dictator and saved Rome from the Gauls.</p>

<a name="note6stanza111"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line991">CXI.</a> Virgil is referring to Caesar and Pompey.</p>

<a name="note6stanza112"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line1000">CXII.</a> L. Mummius captured Corinth, and so ended the war with Greece,
in 146 <small>B.C.</small>, and is clearly referred to here. By 'the man who lofty
Argos shall o'erthrow,' Virgil probably means Aemilius Paullus, who
won the battle of Pydna in 168 <small>B.C.</small> against a king of Macedonia who
called himself a descendant of Achilles.</p>

<a name="note6stanza113"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line1009">CXIII.</a> Cato was the famous censor of 184 <small>B.C.</small> who vainly tried to
check the growth of luxury at Rome. Cossus killed the king of Veii
in 426 <small>B.C.</small> The two Gracchi were great political reformers. The elder
Scipio defeated Hannibal at Zama in 202 <small>B.C.</small>, and his son took
Carthage in 146 <small>B.C.</small> Fabricius was the general who fought against
Pyrrhus, when the latter invaded Italy in 281-75 <small>B.C.</small> Serranus was
a general in the first Punic war. The Fabii of renown are so many
that Anchises only mentions the most famous of them, Q. Fabius
Maximus Cunctator, the general against Hannibal.</p>

<a name="note6stanza115"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line1027">CXV.</a> Marcus Marcellus was a Roman general in the first Punic war.</p>

<a name="note6stanza116"></a>
<p><a href="#book6line1036">CXVI.</a> Marcellus was the son of the Emperor's sister Octavia, and at
the age of 18 he married Augustus' daughter Julia. He was a youth
of great promise, and was destined to succeed his father-in-law, but
he died of fever at the age of 20 in 23 <small>B.C.</small>, amidst universal grief.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO BOOK SEVEN</h3>
<br>

<a name="note7stanza1"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line1">I.</a> 'Thou too, Caieta,' that is to say, as well as Misenus and
Palinurus, mentioned in the last book. Caieta gave her name to the
town and promontory which were on the confines of Latium and
Campania.</p>

<a name="note7stanza2"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line10">II.</a> 'The coast, where Circe'&mdash;Virgil identifies 'the island of
Aeaea,' the dwelling-place of Circe in Homer, with the promontory
of Circeii in Italy.</p>

<a name="note7stanza6"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line46">VI.</a> 'Say, Erato:' Erato was the Muse of Love, and the invocation is
not specially appropriate in this place. But the line is an imitation
of Apollonius Rhodius iii, 1.</p>

<p>'Ausonia,' a poetical name for Italy. The <i>Ausones</i> were early
inhabitants of Campania.</p>

<a name="note7stanza7"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line55">VII.</a> <i>Latinus</i> was king of the Latins, a small tribe whose chief town
was Laurentum. <i>Faunus</i> a god of the fields and cattle-keepers, was
afterwards identified with the Greek Pan. <i>Picus</i> was a prophetic
god. We are told by Ovid that he was changed into a woodpecker
(<i>picus</i>) by Circe, whose love he had slighted. <i>Saturnus</i> was the
old Latin god of sowing, and was later identified with the Greek
Kronos, father of Zeus.</p>

<a name="note7stanza12"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line100">XII.</a> 'Albunea': apparently refers to a wooded hill with a sulphur
spring. Probably it refers to a shrine near some sulphur springs at
Altieri, near Laurentum.</p>

<p>'Oenotria': originally the southern part of Lucania and Bruttium,
but Virgil uses it poetically for the whole of Italy.</p>

<a name="note7stanza13"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line109">XIII.</a> See note on <a href="#note6stanza16">Book VI. stanzas xvi. and xviii.</a></p>

<a name="note7stanza16"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line136">XVI.</a> It was not Anchises, but a Harpy who delivered this prophecy.
See <a href="#book8line253">Book VIII. stanza xxix.</a> This, and other slight inconsistencies
in the <i>Aeneid</i> are undoubtedly due to the fact that Virgil died
before he had revised the poem.</p>

<a name="note7stanza18"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line154">XVIII.</a> 'Phrygia's Mother' was Cybele, the Phrygian goddess.</p>

<a name="note7stanza24"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line208">XXIV.</a> 'Two-faced Janus.' Janus was an old Latin deity, god of the
morning and of gateways. He was represented as 'two-faced,' looking
before and behind. There was a double archway in the forum, called
<i>Janus</i>, which was closed in times of peace, but opened in time of
war. See <a href="#book7line721">stanzas lxxxi., lxxxii.</a></p>

<a name="note7stanza28"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line244">XXVIII.</a> The Auruncans were a tribe living in Campania.</p>

<a name="note7stanza41"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line361">XLI.</a> The <i>Syrtes</i> were two great gulfs on the north coast of Africa.
For Scylla and Charybdis, see note on <a href="#note3stanza55">Book III stanza lv.</a> The Lapithae
were a Thessalian tribe, ruled by Perithous. The Centaurs came to
his marriage feast, and at the instigation of Mars, fought with the
Lapithae until the latter were defeated. 'Diana's ire' was caused
by neglect on the part of king Oeneus of Calydon to sacrifice to her.
She sent a wild boar to ravage the country.</p>

<a name="note7stanza69"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line613">LXIX.</a> 'Trivia's lake' refers to the little lake of Nemi. A famous
temple of Diana stood here, tended by a priest who was a runaway slave.
He gained his office by slaying his predecessor and held it only so
long as he could escape a similar fate. Cf. <a href="#book7line919">stanza ciii.</a></p>

<p>'Velia's fountains,' a lake in the Umbrian hills beyond Reate.</p>

<a name="note7stanza87"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line775">LXXXVII.</a> Agylla was the original name of Caere.</p>

<a name="note7stanza90"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line802">XC.</a> Homole and Othrys were mountains in Thessaly.</p>

<a name="note7stanza91"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line811">XCI.</a> The Anio flows through the hills near Tibur, and joins the Tiber
close to 'Antemnae's tower-girt height.' Cf. <a href="#book7line748">stanza lxxxiv.</a></p>

<p>Anagnia was the largest town of the Hernici, and Amasenus was a river
of Latium.</p>

<a name="note7stanza93"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line829">XCIII.</a> All these places were close to each other in Etruria, a few
miles north of Rome.</p>

<a name="note7stanza94"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line838">XCIV.</a> It is probable that this passage was left unfinished by Virgil.
The simile is taken from Homer, and used here in two different ways,
the poet evidently postponing his final decision as to which he would
adopt, until he revised the poem.</p>

<a name="note7stanza95"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line847">XCV.</a> Clausus, according to a legend preserved by Livy, was a Sabine
who left his own countrymen and joined the Romans. For this he was
rewarded by a gift of land on the Anio. He was regarded as the ancestor
of the Claudian family.</p>

<a name="note7stanza96"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line856">XCVI.</a> The name of the Allia was ill-omened because it was on the banks
of this stream that the Gauls under Brennus inflicted a crushing
defeat on the Romans in 390 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<a name="note7stanza98"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line874">XCVIII.</a> The Oscans were one of the old non-Latin tribes of Italy.
Some fragments of their language still remain.</p>

<a name="note7stanza103"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line919">CIII.</a> The legend was that Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, king of
Athens, was loved by his step-mother Phaedra. Hippolytus rejected
her love, and she killed herself, leaving a writing accusing him of
having tempted her. Theseus in his wrath besought Poseidon to slay
his son, and the latter sent a monster from the sea, which terrified
the horses of Hippolytus so that they ran away and killed their master.
Aesculapius raised him to life, however, and Diana concealed him in
the grove of Aricia under the name of Virbius. The Virbius in the
text is the son of this Hippolytus, also called Virbius.</p>

<a name="note7stanza106"></a>
<p><a href="#book7line946">CVI.</a> Io, the daughter of Inachus, king of Argos, was loved by Jupiter,
and turned by him into a white cow in order to escape the jealousy
of Juno. The latter, however, set Argus with the hundred eyes to watch
her.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO BOOK EIGHT</h3>
<br>

<a name="note8stanza1"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line1">I.</a> Both here and in <a href="#book7line775">Book VII. stanza lxxxvii.</a> Mezentius is called
the 'scorner of the gods.' The meaning of this allusion is not known.
Perhaps it refers to his claiming for himself the first-fruits due
to the gods, a legend mentioned by Macrobius. See <a href="#book8line559">stanzas lxiii. and
lxiv.</a></p>

<a name="note8stanza2"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line10">II.</a> 'Diomed' dwelt at Argyripa or Arpi, a city in Apulia, where he
settled with his Argine followers after the Trojan war.</p>

<a name="note8stanza7"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line55">VII.</a> Pallas is the name of an old Arcadian hero. His grandson Evander
is said to have settled with his followers on the site of Rome, and
called it Pallanteum, after the Arcadian city of that name.</p>

<a name="note8stanza14"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line118">XIV.</a> Hercules was the son of Alcmena and Jupiter. His worship at Rome
dated from very early times, as is shown by the legend&mdash;mentioned
by Livy&mdash;that it was established by Romulus according to Greek usage
as it had been instituted by Evander.</p>

<a name="note8stanza16"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line136">XVI.</a> The olive branch was the sign&mdash;universally recognised in
antiquity&mdash;of a desire for peace.</p>

<a name="note8stanza20"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line172">XX.</a> The Daunian race means the Rutulians. Daunus was the father of
Turnus. Cf. <a href="#book12line19">Book XII. stanza iii.</a></p>

<a name="note8stanza27"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line235">XXVII.</a> Alcides is one of the names given to Hercules. The killing
of Geryon, the three-bodied monster who was king in Spain, and the
driving off of his cattle, was one of the famous 'twelve labours'
of Hercules.</p>

<a name="note8stanza36"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line316">XXXVI.</a> The gens Potitia and the gens Pinaria were the two tribes to
which the care of the worship of Hercules was entrusted.</p>

<a name="note8stanza38"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line334">XXXVIII.-IX.</a> In historic times, the Salians were the twelve priests
of Mars who kept the twelve sacred shields in the temple of that god
on the Palatine hill. Their priesthood was one of the oldest Roman
institutions, and their festival was held on March 1, the first day
of the old Roman year.</p>

<p>'<i>His stepdame's hate</i>' refers to the story that Juno, being jealous
of Alcmena, the mother of Hercules, sent two snakes to destroy the
latter as he lay in his cradle, but the infant hero strangled them.
<i>Eurystheus</i> was the king of Tiryns, whom Hercules had to serve for
twelve years, and at whose command he performed his famous twelve
labours. <i>Pholus</i> and <i>Hylaeus</i> were two Centaurs; they were called
'cloud-born' because they were the offspring of Ixion and a Cloud.
The Cretan monster is the mad bull sent by Neptune to destroy the
land; Hercules came to the rescue and carried it away on his shoulders.
There is no other mention in ancient literature of the fight between
Hercules and Typhoeus. The latter was a hundred-headed
fire-breathing monster, who fought against the gods, and was buried
beneath Mount Aetna.</p>

<a name="note8stanza42"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line370">XLII.-XLVIII.</a> Evander shows the town to Aeneas, tells him of the
former state of Latium, and points out to him the chief places of
interest. <i>Asylum</i>&mdash;Livy tells us that in order to increase the
population, Romulus offered a refuge at Rome to all comers from the
neighbouring towns. The <i>Lupercal</i> was the sanctuary of Lupercus
('wolf-repeller'), an old Roman shepherd god. The <i>Capitol</i> is
referred to as 'now golden,' because in Virgil's time the roof of
the temple of Jupiter Capitotinus was gilded.</p>

<a name="note8stanza50"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line442">L.</a> Thetis, the mother of Achilles, persuaded Vulcan to make arms for
her son, and so had Aurora, the goddess of dawn, 'Tithonus' spouse,'
when her son Memnon went to Troy to fight against the Greeks.</p>

<a name="note8stanza55"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line487">LV.</a> The island here referred to is Hiera, one of the Aeolian isles,
north-east of Sicily. It is now called Volcano. The <i>Cyclops</i> were
originally gigantic one-eyed cannibals who lived a pastoral life
near Mount Aetna. In later legends they are described as the
assistants of Vulcan.</p>

<a name="note8stanza56"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line496">LVI.</a> These three names are Greek and mean 'Fire-anvil,' 'Thunder,'
and 'Lightning,' respectively.</p>

<a name="note8stanza74"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line658">LXXIV.</a> <i>Erulus</i> is not mentioned by any other ancient writer, so we
cannot explain the allusion. <i>Feronia</i> was a Campanian goddess.</p>

<a name="note8stanza78"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line694">LXXVIII.</a> <i>Lucifer</i>, 'the light bringer,' was the name of the morning
star, which, rising just before the sun, seemed to bring the
daylight.</p>

<a name="note8stanza80"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line712">LXXX.</a> The Pelasgians were a very ancient race, of whom only traces
existed in Greece in historic times. They were said to be very
wide-spread, but the tales connecting them with Italy are all
unhistoric. <i>Silvanus</i> was an ancient Latin woodland deity.</p>

<a name="note8stanza84"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line748">LXXXIV.</a> The story, as related by Livy, is that the Romans being in
want of wives, Romulus instituted games in honour of Neptune. At a
given signal, the Romans seized and carried off the Sabine maidens
who had come to see the games.</p>

<a name="note8stanza85"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line757">LXXXV.</a> <i>Mettus</i>, dictator of Alba, had been called in to assist the
Romans under Tullus Hostilius. He came, but withdrew his troops in
the middle of the battle. For this treachery he was punished in the
way Virgil describes. <i>Horatius Cocles</i> was the hero who guarded the
Tiber bridge against Porsenna of Clusium. <i>Cloelia</i> was a Roman
maiden who had been sent as a hostage to Porsenna. She escaped by
swimming across the Tiber.</p>

<a name="note8stanza86"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line766">LXXXVI.</a> The event here referred to is the invasion of Rome by the
Gauls in 390 <small>B.C.</small> They captured the whole of the city, except the
Capitol, which was successfully defended by Manlius, who had been
put on the alert by the cackling of a flock of geese.</p>

<a name="note8stanza87"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line775">LXXXVII.</a> See note on <a href="#note8stanza38">stanza xxxviii.</a> The <i>Luperci</i> were the priests
of Lupercus. <i>Catiline</i> was the author of the conspiracy of <small>B.C.</small> 63.
Cicero, the famous orator, was consul for that year and frustrated
the plot. <i>Cato</i> the younger died at Utica in 49 <small>B.C.</small> In the Roman
writers Catiline is always the proverbial scoundrel and Cato is
always taken as the model of rigid and exalted virtue.</p>

<a name="note8stanza88"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line784">LXXXVIII.</a> At the battle of Actium, in <small>B.C.</small> 31, the fleet of Augustus
met those of Antony and Cleopatra, and owing to the desertion of the
Egyptians at the crisis of the fight, gained a complete victory over
them.</p>

<a name="note8stanza90"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line802">XC.</a> The Cyclads were the western islands of the Greek archipelago.</p>

<a name="note8stanza94"></a>
<p><a href="#book8line838">XCIV.</a> The Carians lived in the south of Asia Minor, the Gelonians
beyond the Danube, and the Morini on the North Sea, near where Ostend
now is. The Dahae were a tribe of Scythians, and the Leleges were
an ancient people spread over Asia Minor.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO BOOK NINE</h3>
<br>

<a name="note9stanza1"></a>

<a name="note9stanza14"></a>
<p><a href="#book9line118">XIV.</a> The 'brother' is Pluto, god of the lower world. To swear by the
Styx was the most dread and binding oath; it was inviolable even by
the gods.</p>

<a name="note9stanza18"></a>
<p><a href="#book9line154">XVIII.</a> The reference here is to the story of how Paris, son of Priam,
king of Troy, seized Helen, the wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta,
and so caused the Trojan war. Menelaus and Agamemnon were the sons
of Atreus.</p>

<a name="note9stanza28"></a>
<p><a href="#book9line244">XXVIII.</a> For Acestes see note on <a href="#note5stanza6">Book V. stanza vi.</a></p>

<a name="note9stanza33"></a>
<p><a href="#book9line289">XXXIII.</a> Assaracus was an ancestor of the Trojan race, and his
household gods would of course be the tutelary spirits of the Trojan
royal family.</p>

<a name="note9stanza52"></a>
<p><a href="#book9line460">LII.</a> <i>Latonia</i>. The daughter of Leto, and sister of Apollo, Diana,
who was identified with the Greek Artemis, the goddess of the woods
and of hunting.</p>

<a name="note9stanza72"></a>
<p><a href="#book9line640">LXXII.</a> 'Jove's armour-bearer' is the eagle.</p>

<p><a href="#book9line667">LXXV.</a> The Symaethus was a river in Sicily.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>NOTES TO BOOK TEN</h3>
<br>

<a name="note10stanza1"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line1">I.</a> Olympus was a mountain in Thessaly, and was believed by the Greeks
to be the home of the gods. Hence it came to be used for 'heaven';
as in the present passage.</p>

<a name="note10stanza2"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line10">II.</a> Jupiter is referring to the invasion of Italy by Hannibal in 218
<small>B.C.</small></p>

<a name="note10stanza4"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line28">IV.</a> Diomedes, the son of Tydeus from Aetolia, is said to have settled,
after the Trojan war, in Apulia, where he founded the city of Arpi.
The Latins, it will be remembered, had asked him to help them against
the Trojans. See <a href="#book8line10">Book VIII. stanza ii.</a> And for the result of the
embassy, <a href="#book11line271">Book XI. stanza xxxi.</a> and following.</p>

<a name="note10stanza6"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line46">VI.</a> For the burning of the vessels at Eryx, see <a href="#book5line730">Book V. stanzas lxxxii.</a>
and following. For <i>Aeolia</i> <a href="#book1line64">Book I. stanzas viii. to xx.</a> For <i>Alecto</i>
<a href="#book7line388">Book VII. stanzas xliv.</a> and following.</p>

<a name="note10stanza8"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line64">VIII.</a> Paphos, Amathus, and Idalium were towns in Cyprus. Cythera is
an island off the southern coast of Greece. All four were celebrated
in antiquity as centres of the worship of Venus.</p>

<a name="note10stanza14"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line118">XIV.</a> The robber was Paris, who carried off Helen.</p>

<a name="note10stanza21"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line181">XXI.</a> <i>Ismarus</i> was a prince from Lydia, a district in Asia Minor,
called Maeonia in ancient times. The Pactolus was a river in Maeonia,
famous on account of the quantity of gold it washed down. The 'Capuan
town' is Capua.</p>

<a name="note10stanza23"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line199">XXIII.</a> The lions are there because Cybele the Phrygian goddess,
worshipped by the Trojans on Mount Ida, was drawn in her chariot by
two lions. The figure-head of Aeneas' ship was probably an image of
a goddess, personifying the mountain.</p>

<a name="note10stanza24"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line208">XXIV.</a> Mount Helicon is in Boeotia, and was sacred to Apollo and the
Muses. <i>Clusium</i> and <i>Cosae</i> were Etruscan cities.</p>

<a name="note10stanza25"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line217">XXV.</a> <i>Populonia:</i> a town on the coast of Etruria. <i>Ilva</i> (the modern
Elba): an island off the coast of Etruria near Populonia.</p>

<a name="note10stanza27"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line235">XXVII.</a> Cinyras and Cupavo were sons of Cycnus. The legend tells us
that Pha&euml;thon rashly attempted to drive the chariot of the sun, and
was killed by a thunderbolt from Jupiter, while so doing. Cycnus,
who was devotedly attached to him, was changed into a swan while
lamenting his death.</p>

<a name="note10stanza28"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line244">XXVIII.</a> Mantua was Virgil's birthplace. Hence probably the insertion
of this tradition as to its origin. Mincius, mentioned in the <a href="#book10line253">next
stanza,</a> is a Lombard river, the Mincio, and flows out from Lake
Benacus (Lago di Garda).</p>

<a name="note10stanza37"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line325">XXXVII.</a> Sirius, the dog-star, whose rising was supposed to coincide
with the hot weather, is always spoken of as bringing pestilence and
trouble. The connection between Sirius and the hot weather was one
of the conventions of poetry which the Augustan writers had borrowed
from the Greeks.</p>

<a name="note10stanza67"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line595">LXVII.</a> The story referred to is that of the fifty daughters of Danaus,
who were married to the fifty sons of Aegyptus, their cousins. Danaus
ordered his daughters to murder their husbands on their wedding night,
and they all obeyed except Hypermnestra, who loved her husband
Lynceus, and so saved his life.</p>

<a name="note10stanza73"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line649">LXXIII.</a> Trivia here refers to Diana. Gradivus is an archaic Latin
name for Mars.</p>

<a name="note10stanza77"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line685">LXXVII.</a> 'Mute Amyclae' was probably so called because the
inhabitants had been forbidden, owing to false alarms, to speak of
the approach of an enemy. But if Virgil is referring, not to the
Amyclae near Naples, but to the original Amyclae in Laconia, then
the proverbial taciturnity of those inhabiting the latter country
offers sufficient explanation. <i>Aegeon</i> was a monster with 100 arms
and 50 heads. He is more often called Briareus.</p>

<a name="note10stanza79"></a>
<p><a href="#book10line703">LXXIX.</a> In the <i>Iliad</i> Aeneas had been rescued from Diomedes and
Achilles. Liger is taunting him with this.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>NOTES TO BOOK ELEVEN</h3>
<br>

<a name="note11stanza31"></a>
<p><a href="#book11line271">XXXI.</a> <i>Iapygia</i>, a Greek name for the southern part of Apulia.</p>

<p><i>Garganus:</i> name of a mountain in Apulia.</p>

<p>See also note on <a href="#note10stanza4">Book X. stanza iv.</a></p>

<a name="note11stanza33"></a>
<p><a href="#book11line289">XXXIII.</a> The references in this stanza are (1) to the storm which
Minerva (Pallas) raised when the Greeks set sail from Troy. (2) To
the story of Nauplius, king of Euboea, who hung false lights over
the headland of Caphareus, and so caused the wreck of the Greek fleet.</p>

<a name="note11stanza34"></a>
<p><a href="#book11line298">XXXIV.</a> 'Proteus' Pillars' means Egypt, and the stories of Menelaus,
as also the adventures of Ulysses with the Cyclops, will be found
in the <i>Odyssey</i>. For <i>Pyrrhus</i> see note on <a href="#note3stanza43">Book III. stanza xliii.</a>
For <i>Idomeneus</i>, that on <a href="#book3line145">Book III. stanza xvii.</a> Agamemnon was killed
by his wife and her lover, when he returned home at the end of the
Trojan war.</p>

<a name="note11stanza35"></a>
<p><a href="#book11line307">XXXV.</a> Calydon was the ancient home of Diomedes in Aetolia.</p>

<a name="note11stanza52"></a>
<p><a href="#book11line460">LII.</a> The Myrmidons were the followers of Achilles&mdash;Tydides is
Diomedes. The <i>Aufidus</i> is a river of Apulia.</p>

<a name="note11stanza69"></a>
<p><a href="#book11line613">LXIX.</a> Opis was a nymph of Diana (Latonia).</p>

<a name="note11stanza84"></a>
<p><a href="#book11line748">LXXXIV.</a> Virgil is comparing Camilla to the two famous Amazons,
Hippolyte who was married to Theseus, and Penthesilea who fought for
Troy and was slain by Achilles.</p>

<a name="note11stanza108"></a>
<p><a href="#book11line964">CVIII.</a> [Transcriber's note: The rhyme, the meter, and the sense of the phrase
require a word here that is missing from the published text.
Possibly "flight" or "sight" was intended by the translator.]</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>NOTES TO BOOK TWELVE</h3>
<br>

<a name="note12stanza11"></a>
<p><a href="#book12line91">XI.</a> Orithyia was the wife of Boreas the North Wind, who according
to legend was the father of the royal horses of Troy.</p>

<a name="note12stanza25"></a>
<p><a href="#book12line217">XXV.</a> The two children of Latona were Apollo and Diana.</p>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
